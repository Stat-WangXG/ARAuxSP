\title{Fit additive risk model with auxiliary subgroup survival rates using EL}
\usage{
AR.AuxSP.EL(yobs, delta, X, tstar, phi, G, maxit = 30, tol = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{tstar}{auxiliary time point (only 1 is allowed).}

\item{phi}{auxiliary survival rates (length(phi)=nrow(G)).}

\item{G}{indicator matrix - one row indicates one group.}
}
\value{
A list \code{out} representing the fit,
which contains the following elements:
\code{coef} for estimated coefficients,
\code{convergence} for the optimizatoin is converged or not.
}
\description{
This is a function used to fit the additive risk model
in the presence of subgroup survival rates as auxiliary information
based on the empirical likelihood framework.
