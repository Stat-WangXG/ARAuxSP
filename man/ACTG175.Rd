\description{
ACTG 175 was a randomized clinical trial to compare monotherapy
with zidovudine or didanosine with combination therapy with zidovudine and
didanosine or zidovudine and zalcitabine in adults infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus type I whose CD4 T cell counts were between 200 and
500 per cubic millimeter.

\details{
The variable days contains right-censored time-to-event observations.
The data set includes the following post-randomization covariates: CD4 and CD8
T cell count at 20\\pm5 weeks and the indicator of whether or not the patient
was taken off-treatment before 96\\pm5 weeks.
